* ApiCommonData

We load data in our databases by running workflows. These are the scripts and plugins used by the workflows;  
it also contains the schema definition files. Api stands for 'Apicomplexan'. These are the first organisms included in our websites 
when they were first time publicly released as ApiDB BRC (Bioinformatics Resource Center), back in 2002.
