             Mass spectrometry data were obtained from one-dimensional gel LC-MS/MS and MudPIT analysis of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. 6,546 protein hits were obtained resulting in 2217 non-redundant protein identifications. A further 318 hits were obtained to sequences which matched 226 predicted open reading frames for which no gene model currently exists.  Additionally, 163 gene predictions were hit that did not have an overlapping gene model to which at least 50% of the peptides could be mapped.

             Taken together, these two datasets result in 8,433 protein hits to 2,436 non-redundant Toxoplasma proteins and 816 hits to 634 non-redundant ORFs that contain peptides that couldn't be mapped to annotated proteins. 
             With the additional evidence from the predicted gene models, nearly 40% of the predicted proteome from T. gondii is represented.  The data provide evidence that often corroborates the annotated gene models and in some instances the peptides mapping to ORFs and predicted gene models provide evidence for alternatives to the current annotations.

             Mass spectrometry data were obtained from one-dimensional gel LC-MS/MS and MudPIT analysis of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. 6,546 protein hits were obtained resulting in 2217 non-redundant protein identifications. A further 318 hits were obtained to sequences which matched 226 predicted open reading frames for which no gene model currently exists.  Additionally, 163 gene predictions were hit that did not have an overlapping gene model to which at least 50% of the peptides could be mapped.  In total these protein identifications from one stage represent nearly one third of the entire predicted proteome of T. gondii.

             1,887 protein hits were obtained resulting in 1,166 non-redundant protein identifications. A further 498 hits were obtained to sequences which matched 446 predicted open reading frames for which no gene model currently exists.

             Taken together, these two datasets result in 8,433 protein hits to 2,436 non-redundant Toxoplasma proteins and 816 hits to 634 non-redundant ORFs that contain peptides that couldn't be mapped to annotated proteins. 
             With the additional evidence from the predicted gene models, nearly 40% of the predicted proteome from T. gondii is represented.  The data provide evidence that often corroborates the annotated gene models and in some instances the peptides mapping to ORFs and predicted gene models provide evidence for alternatives to the current annotations.

WB (genome project strain) Giardia lamblia grown axenically in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with bile salts.  Adherent trophozoites were harvested during log-phase growth (60-70% confluent) and proteins extracted in 8M Urea and SDS.  1 mg of extracted protein was digested with sequencing-grade modified trypsin and fractionated via strong cation exchange chromatography into 90 fractions.  Each fraction was run via C-18 reverse phase chromatography and analyzed using an LTQ ProteomeX ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan).  Peptide assignments were made using SEQUEST, and the individual runs were compiled using DTASelect.
