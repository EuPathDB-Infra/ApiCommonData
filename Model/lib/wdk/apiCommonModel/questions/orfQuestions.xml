Mass spectrometry data were obtained from two-dimensional gel 
electrophoretic protein separations, one-dimensional gel LC-MS/MS and 
MudPIT analysis of a sporozoite/oocyst excystation mixture of 
<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>.  A total of approximately 3,500 protein 
hits were obtained resulting in 1,252 non-redundant protein identifications.  
In addition a further 100 hits were obtained to sequences which matched a 
predicted open reading frame, but for which no gene model currently exists.  
In total these protein identifications represent nearly one third of the 
entire predicted proteome of <i>C. parvum</i>, although it is unlikely 
that the entire proteome from all life-stages will be expressed at any 
one time.

Enriched cytoskeletal and membrane fractions were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE or 2D gel electrophoresis. The bands/spots were digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a ThermoFinnigan linear ion trap (LTQ) mass spectrometer.  MASCOT was used to search the merged DTA mass spectrometry data file against the appropriate database to obtained unique peptide hits.  In order to extend the dynamic range of the membrane fractions, high pH sodium carbonate was used to remove the peripheral membrane proteins. For a few experiments, the remaining cytosolic fractions were also analyzed.

Subcellular proteomic analysis of <i>C. parvum</i> oocysts. Proteome analysis was carried out on two components of the oocyst after excystation. (1) the proteins identified in the sporozoites and (2) the proteins identified belonging to residual oocyst wall.  Furthermore, proteome analysis was also carried on the intact oocyst.  Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify proteins unique to each subcellular component, and also to identify proteins shared between fractions

In addition a further 100 hits were obtained to sequences which matched a 
predicted open reading frame, but for which no gene model currently exists.  
In total these protein identifications represent nearly one third of the 
entire predicted proteome of <i>C. parvum</i>, although it is unlikely 
that the entire proteome from all life-stages will be expressed at any 
one time.

             Mass spectrometry data were obtained from one-dimensional gel LC-MS/MS and MudPIT analysis of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. 6,546 protein hits were obtained resulting in 2217 non-redundant protein identifications. A further 318 hits were obtained to sequences which matched 226 predicted open reading frames for which no gene model currently exists.  Additionally, 163 gene predictions were hit that did not have an overlapping gene model to which at least 50% of the peptides could be mapped.  In total these protein identifications from one stage represent nearly one third of the entire predicted proteome of T. gondii.

WB (genome project strain) Giardia lamblia grown axenically in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with bile salts.  Adherent trophozoites were harvested during log-phase growth (60-70% confluent) and proteins extracted in 8M Urea and SDS.  1 mg of extracted protein was digested with sequencing-grade modified trypsin and fractionated via strong cation exchange chromatography into 90 fractions.  Each fraction was run via C-18 reverse phase chromatography and analyzed using an LTQ ProteomeX ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan).  Peptide assignments were made using SEQUEST, and the individual runs were compiled using DTASelect.
