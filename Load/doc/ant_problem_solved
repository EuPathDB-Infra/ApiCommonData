Apache Ant Mystery Error Solved

Today I went around with a little problem with Apache Ant. It had me stumped for a while, so I thought I would share my gained wisdom.

I was trying to build the latest beta release of DSpace, which involves running ant. For some reason, I was getting some pretty weird errors, so I checked and found out that I was using an older version of Ant (1.5.2, I think). The latest version is 1.6.1, so I thought I would upgrade and see whether that fixed the problem.

Well, not upgrade, exactly, since earlier today I had just installed RedHat Linux Enterprise WS. It comes pre-installed with Ant, and I didn't want to delete that copy. However, it is very common on Linux systems to run multiple versions of a program (just watch the symlinks and your $PATH!), so I was not worried.

I downloaded and installed the binary version of 1.6.1 from Apache, but it produced a segfault every time I ran ant. I never did figure that one out, but no problem, since I could compile my own from source, right?

Yeah, great thinking. After it bootstrapped itself a couple of times during the build, I got this message:

    Exception in thread "main " java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/tools/ant/launch/Launcher

I tried everything I could think of, searching the Internet for clues. I munged my $CLASSPATH, my $ANT_HOME, my $PATH, and anything else I could think of. All the suggestions from the 'net were coming up a dead end. Or so I thought...

I found this message describing the same problem and what seemed like an odd solution. On RedHat Enterprise, you may have the following directory: /usr/share/ant If you do, removing/renaming the directory will solve the problem.

Apparently, this type of problem happens when trying to run two versions of Ant concurrently on one system. Not everyone has these problems, and for some a different fix solves the problem. But for me, this did the trick: after renaming the directory, the new version of Ant compiled and DSpace compiled as well.

Some questions do still remain:

   1. Why did the compilation of DSpace with the included version of Ant fail initially?
   2. Why did the binary version of 1.6.1 downloaded from Apache fail with a segfault continually?
   3. What is the root cause of the error message on systems with the /usr/share/ant problem? The directory has a README file that specifically mentions that the JAR file inside the directory has nothing to do with the main system Ant, and so removal should certainly not interfere.
   4. Why would this directory and its included JAR file have any effect when running a different version of Ant that could not possibly reference it (that is, all $PATH statements referenced a new version, etc.)? It acted almost as if it were resident in memory or something equally bizarre that could not possibly have been the case.
   5. Why does this problem manifest itself during attempted installation of DSpace as the following error that seems to indicate missing classes from the JDK (which are in fact not missing):

          [javac] Compiling 132 source files to /home/asnagy/dspace-1_2-beta2-source/build/classes
          [javac] /home/asnagy/dspace-1_2-beta2-source/src/org/dspace/app/mediafilter/HTMLFilter.java:49: error: Class or interface `javax.swing.text.ChangedCharSetException" not
          found in import.
          [javac] import javax.swing.text.ChangedCharSetException;

          er.java:125: error: Type `HTMLEditorKit" not found in the declaration of the local
          variable `kit".

          [javac] /home/asnagy/dspace-1_2-beta2-source/src/org/dspace/app/mediafilter/JPEGFilt

          [javac] import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
          [javac] ^
          [javac] 3 errors

   6. What will happen to my RedHat system when I use the auto-update feature and it wants to patch Ant? I guess if I notice a recurrence of this problem, I'll know where to look, but that's irritating.

One option, I suppose, is simply to remove the default Ant package that comes with RedHat Enterprise. To me that seems harsh. Posted by Jason on June 30, 2004 08:04 PM | TrackBack | Links to this post

This made my day. Thank you for sharing...

I had this identical problem on Fedora2. Simply renaming the /usr/share/ant obviously takes it out of the search path and allows you to use your own install of ant.

Note that there are many problems like this, for instance with MySQL i had a very similar problem... it's always an interesting point to keep in mind.
