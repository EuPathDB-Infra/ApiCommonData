Create SNP variation files, one per strain, for use by the HighSpeedSnpSearch system (C based SNP searches).

Usage:  createHighSpeedSnpSearchStrainFiles variants_file varscan_dir target_dir read_freq_cutoff ref_strain

Where:
  variants_file:     a file containing all variants for all strains.  Within each sequence, the variants are
                     grouped by SNP, and the SNPs are ordered by location.  Thus we get a series of variants
                     per SNP, for each SNP.  Each SNP includes a variant for the reference strain.  The variants
                     each have this info: strain, seq_id, location, allele, product, matches_reference

  varscan_dir:       a directory containing one varscan file for each strain we will make an output file for.
                     The files are named for with the strain name.

  target_dir:        the directory in which to place the new directory that will hold the strain files created

  read_freq_cutoff:  ignore variants that have a read frequency below this cutoff.

  ref_strain:        the name of the reference strain


Details:

Create a directory called readFreqXX where XX is the read_freq_cutoff supplied on the command line.  (Read frequency is
the percentage of reads at this location that support an allele.)  The output strain files are created in that directory.

Each output strain file is named for the strain's strain index, which is generated by this program.  The strain index for a strain is
its position in the alphabetical list of strain file names as found in the varscan directory.  The strain file is compliant with the
HighSpeedSnpSearch system.  They are binary with four columns: seq_index, location, allele_code, product_code.  Variants that match
the reference strain are omitted from the file.  Strains which do not have an above-threshold variant at a SNP are included in the
file for that SNP, indicated as 'unknown'.  The allele and product are set to 0 to indicate this.  If a strain is heterozygous
at a SNP (above threshold) then all its variants are included, including any those that are like reference.

SNPs are excluded from consideration if they have no variants at or above the read frequency threshold, or if all those that are
above it match the reference.

This program also writes an additional three files into the readFreqXX directory:
  - contigIdToSourceId.dat:  a mapping from sequence index to source_id
  - referenceGenome.dat:     a train file like all the others, but for the reference genome
  - strainIdToName.dat:      a mapping from the strain index to strain name
