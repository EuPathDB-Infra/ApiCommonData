    <prop name="libraryDesc">Toxoplasma gondii RH tachyzoites were infected into Vero (T25) cells and incubated in EMEM medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum for 72 hours in vitro. Infected cells were collected with a scraper and passed through 27G needle for three times and purified by filtration through Millex SV filters (pore size 5 um, Millipore). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min and washed in EMEM medium without FBS. Parasites were suspended at 1x107/ml in EMEM medium without FBS. Five-week old ICR female mice were infected with 1 ml parasites intraperitoneally.Three days after infection, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Parasites were collected by washing the peritoneal cavity with 5 ml EMEM, passed through 5 um filter, washed in PBS and suspended at 2-3x109 parasite/ml. 20 ml TRI REGENT (Sigma) was added to 1 ml parasite solution, mixed by pipetting, frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80C until used.</prop>
