-- This script drops "orphan" tuning tables.
--
-- Tuning tables always consist of a table with a name like "GeneAttributes1234",
-- together with a synonym, like "GeneAttributes", pointing at it. That's what
-- makes it possible to make a new GeneAttributes while the web site is using the
-- current GeneAttributes.
--
-- If a tuning table build fails, the table can be left behind. This script drops
-- these orphaned tuning tables. They can be recognized because their names end
-- in four digits but no synonym points at them.
--
-- NOTE THAT THIS SCRIPT MUST BE RUN AS THE APIDBTUNING USER
-- (or whichever schema is to be purged)
