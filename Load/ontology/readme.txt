Ontology Directory
==============

EuPath ontology: 
	- development version - under ‘src’ directory
	- release version - under ‘release’ directory

Projects / datasets:
	- Gates
	- ICEMR
	- Microbiome

Each project/dataset has one folder, contains:
	OWL file: dataset display terminology
	‘doc’ directory: data dictionary and following documents to ontology mappings.

Files under ‘doc’ directory:
	- The filename of initial metadata file generated from data providers’ data dictionary: projectName_variables.xlsx
	- The filename of intermediate metadata file as: projectName_terms.xlsx
	- The filename of final metadata file for data loading as: projectName_ontology_mapping.xlsx (including column name to ontology term mapping)


Details of files:
===========
