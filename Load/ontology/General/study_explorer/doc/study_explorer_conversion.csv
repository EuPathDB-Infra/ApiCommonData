Aggregated data includes what can be seen in the �Browse and subset� and �Visualize� tabs, while disaggregated data includes what can be seen in filed downloaded from the �Download� tab. (i) Public: No access restrictions. Users can view and download the data as �Guests� without logging in. (ii) Controlled: Guest users can view aggregated data via the �Browse and subset� and �Visualize� tabs, but must register and request access to download data. The request may be submitted via a form that pops up when a user logs in with a registered account and clicks on any file in the �Download� tab. Data can be downloaded by the registered user immediately following request submission. (iii) Protected: Guest users can view aggregated data via the �Browse and subset� and �Visualize� tabs, but must register, request, and obtain approval from the data providers to download data. The request may be submitted via a form that pops up when a registered user is logged in and clicks on any file in the �Download� tab. (iv) Private: A registered user must request and obtain approval to access any aspect of the data. The request may be submitted via a form that pops up when a registered user is logged in and clicks on the study.
